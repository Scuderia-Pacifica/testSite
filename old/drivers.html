                    I was born July 2007 in Champigny-SÃ»r-Marne, France. I have loved Cars for as long as I can
                    remember and was born in a Family that loved Cars, being introduced to them Early on in my life.
                    I started Sim-racing online at the age of 9 on Assetto Corsa and Gran Turismo, and drove my
                    first car at the age of 11. I started racing physically December 26th 2020 in the Pacific GP
                    League Series in the Pro-Am Category. I now race in the Pacific GP Pro League Series with 425
                    Motorsports, and am the leading Junior Driver in the Series.

                    My racing career started way before I got behind the wheel in the summer of 2019. It started
                    when I was three, when I first watched cars, and from what I heard i was truly captivated by the
                    cars themselves and from there on I lost myself in the family tradition of cars. Fast forward to
                    when I started racing karts was because, the final push ended up being drive to survive on
                    Netflix, which is a show about the background of formula 1. That summer I went out to pgp to do
                    the junior driver test and I passed and after about a year of practice I went to pro-am in my
                    first season Finished 4th in the championship and the following one I won the championship by
                    ten points after a season long battle with the runner up and now I am driving in the pro
                    category and hope to make my mark in 206 series in karting with this new team Scuderia Pacifica.
