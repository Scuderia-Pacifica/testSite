      <h1>Adrien Dumont</h1>
        <p>I was born July 2007 in Champigny-SÃ»r-Marne, France. I have loved Cars for as long as I can remember and was born in a Family that loved Cars, being introduced to them Early on in my life. I started Sim-racing online at the age of 9 on Assetto Corsa and Gran Turismo, and drove my first car at the age of 11. I started racing physically December 26th 2020 in the Pacific GP League Series in the Pro-Am Category. I now race in the Pacific GP Pro League Series with 425 Motorsports, and am the leading Junior Driver in the Series.</p>

    <h1>Damian Lopez</h1>
    <p>My racing career started way before I got behind the wheel in the summer of 2019. It started when I was three, when I first watched cars, and from what I heard i was truly captivated by the cars themselves and from there on I lost myself in the family tradition of cars. Fast forward to when I started racing karts was because, the final push ended up being drive to survive on Netflix, which is a show about the background of formula 1. That summer I went out to pgp to do the junior driver test and I passed and after about a year of practice I went to pro-am in my first season Finished 4th in the championship and the following one I won the championship by ten points after a season long battle with the runner up and now I am driving in the pro category and hope to make my mark in 206 series in karting with this new team Scuderia Pacifica. there you go</p>
